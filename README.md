<h1>House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>

<p>This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can forecast the price of a house based on its attributes.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The house price prediction model is based on <strong>regression</strong> techniques and uses data from a housing dataset. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, engineer features, train multiple models, and evaluate their performance. It aims to provide an end-to-end solution for predicting house prices.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To run this project locally, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:</li>
  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git</code></pre>
  <li>Navigate to the project folder:</li>
  <pre><code>cd house-price-prediction</code></pre>
  <li>Install the required dependencies:</li>
  <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
</ol>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project can be found in the <code>data/</code> folder. If you have a different dataset, make sure it has the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Living Area (sqft)</li>
  <li>Lot Area (sqft)</li>
  <li>Number of Bedrooms</li>
  <li>Number of Bathrooms</li>
  <li>Year Built</li>
  <li>Condition</li>
  <li>Location (e.g., city or neighborhood)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modeling</h2>
<p>We used the following models to predict house prices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Linear Regression</strong>: A basic model to establish a baseline.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision Tree Regressor</strong>: A non-linear model that splits data based on feature values.</li>
  <li><strong>XGBoost</strong>: An advanced gradient boosting model for better performance on complex data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>R-squared (RÂ²)</strong>: Proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.</li>
  <li><strong>RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)</strong>: Measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values.</li>
  <li><strong>MAE (Mean Absolute Error)</strong>: Average of absolute errors between predicted and actual values.</li>
</ul>
